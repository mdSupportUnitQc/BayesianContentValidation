# Questionnaire validation instrument using both frequentist and Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis
With an user-friendly Bayesian web-application, we aim at improving the use of preliminary study data and data of small sample size in primary health care research. The web app is designed for researchers and clinicians with any level of statistical training who are interested in validating a questionnaire. The tool uses confirmatory factor analysis to estimate relative importance of each question with respect to its domain, i.e. item-domain correlation. Analyses present results from both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

Here is the current version.
