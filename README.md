This web app is designed for researchers and clinicians with any level of statistical training who are interested in validating a questionnaire. The tool uses confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to estimate relative importance of each question with respect to its domain, i.e. item-domain correlation. The web app output presents results from both classic and Bayesian CFA.

Here is the current version (Beta 3.0, last updated Mar 20, 2018)
